# Align Cursor to Edges
Rotate Blender's 3D cursor to align its axes with selected edges. Active edge takes precedence when selected edges are not at a right angle to each other.

## Usage
In edit mode, select two edges and choose command `Align 3D Cursor to Edges` from the command palette. To then work in the coordinate system of the aligned 3D cursor, set "Transform Orientation" to "Cursor".
